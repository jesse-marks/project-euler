# Project Euler: Python Solutions
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) sits at the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and coding. Here are the solution to the first XX problems. *Note*, it is OK to post the solution to the first 100 problems but they do not want anything beyond this posted. 


```
...the rule about sharing solutions outside of Project Euler does not apply to the first one-hundred problems,
as long as any discussion clearly aims to instruct methods, not just provide answers, and does not directly 
threaten to undermine the enjoyment of solving later problems. Problems 1 to 100 provide a wealth of 
helpful introductory teaching material and if you are able to respect our requirements, then we give 
permission for those problems and their solutions to be discussed elsewhere.
